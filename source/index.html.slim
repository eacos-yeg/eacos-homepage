      | EACOS is an advocate for Edmonton’s tech-enabled startup community. We are comprised of 13 individuals from scaleups, startups, seed companies, students, and investors. Our mandate is to be a voice for our peer-startups, activating and aligning resources with the needs of our technology community at large.

    | For 2019 we have organized our goals into 3 themes. We have selected a
      series of goals and themes that we are advocating for over the next year.
      We have chosen to focus on these goals because we believe they can have a
      big impact on the community in a short amount of time.

    p
      | EACOS believes that publicly-funded service providers (entities with
        programs and mandates aiming to support and grow the startup/innovation
        ecosystem such as Startup Edmonton & TEC Edmonton) have a critical role to
        play in the growth and success of a startup community.

    h3 Increasing Deployment of Private Capital
    p
      | EACOS’s objective is to not only identify levers for action which may
        increase private capital deployed in Edmonton, but to address the
        underlying issue of increasing the number of investment-ready companies
        in Edmonton.
